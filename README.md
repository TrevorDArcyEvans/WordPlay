# WordPlay
A simulator built to explore the dynamics of the Wordle Online word game.

In Late December 2021, the word game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) blew up in popularity

The Game's simplicity was part of its charm:

- A player successively guesses 5-letter words up to six times.
- Each guess earns a response of a non-match, a partial match, or a full match
- Players who guess 6 times without matching 'lose'
- All players play the same word each day (as defined by local timezone)

The game also came with a feature that made it easy to share and compare on social media :

## Initial Exploration

This game seemed sufficiently constrained that an automated exploration of the combinatorics was tempting.
